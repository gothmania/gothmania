# Who am I?

I'm Long Hoang, a junior Vietnamese general epidemiologist. I was born in 1988 in Hanoi, Vietnam. I am particularly interested in epidemiologic methods for hospital-based studies, registry studies, and causal inference methods. I am also interested in biostatistical methods for these designs.
